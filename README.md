## Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow ##

An attempt at implementing a DQN similar to DeepMind's DQN algorithm from the papers ["Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) and ["Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) using TensorFlow.

Special thanks to David Silver from DeepMind for [his course](https://youtu.be/2pWv7GOvuf0?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-) on Reinforcement Learning.

This is continuing work in progress.
